#HOW TO USE

The analyser can be used following these steps:

#1
The first step is executing the program. There are three options in order to execute the program: 
  1. Using the .exe for MAC.
  2. Using the .exe for Windows.
  3. Executing the program directly using python.
For the first two options one can simply open the corresponding .exe file on their computer, which will automatically deploy your terminal with the program interface. In the case of the third option, one can simply run the file 'main.py' of the source code and the program will be visible and operational in the python console or in the terminal.

#2
Once the program is executed, the first thing it demands is for the user to type the absolute path (eg. /Users/Jaewooklee/github/Sorâ€¦) of the input text file 
that will be analysed. When using the .exe file, since this file has been created in another computer, it can be seen that there is a default path already set, 
but that should not matter since the user can introduce her/his own path. After typing the path the user should press enter.

#3
After setting the directory, the user should be able to see, in the terminal or in the python console, the available textfiles from the specific chosen directory.
The user should again type the name of the file he/she wants to analyse including the ".txt" at the end. After typing the file name the user should press enter. 

#4
The program is automatically executed after the input of the user. After the execution, the results should be printed in the termianl or the python console. 
Furthermore, a file called 'testoutput.txt' will be saved in the same directory that the user typed earlier. This text file contains the same information that is
printed on the screen. 

#5
After this, the program closes itself autonomously. In order to use it again the user would need to go again through the same steps that have just been presented.
